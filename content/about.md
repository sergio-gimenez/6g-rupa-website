Welcome! :wave: This website is all about a new paradigm for future mobile networks, specifically for the so called 6G.

## What are we researching? 🔍

We're researching a more flexible way to provide a data plane for mobile networks. It's what we call **6G-RUPA** (6G Recursive User Plane Architecture). That sounds like a lot of jargon, right? Let's break it down:

* We're trying to make mobile networks more flexible 🔄
* We want them to scale better 📈
* We're providing mechanisms to effectively build what is called a *network of networks* 🌐
* Our ideas could help create new apps and services that aren't possible right now :sparkles:

## Why This Matters 🌟

Mobile networks have been evolving rapidly over the past few decades. However, there are some protocols, specifically the so-called "user plane protocols" 📡 (which handle the actual transfer of user data) that had remained untouched **for almost 30 years**!

We believe that by rethinking how this part of mobile networks work, we can create more **efficient** and **sustainable** mobile networks for the future.

## Who's Behind This? 👥

I'm [Sergio Gimenez](https://sergiogimenez.com), a PhD student working on ideas for future mobile networks.

I created this website to share my research in a way that's easy for everyone to understand. 

But I'm not alone! My supervisors [Edu Grasa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduard-grasa-2aa97b8/) and [Jordi Perelló](https://personals.ac.upc.edu/perello/) support and guide me in this journey.
